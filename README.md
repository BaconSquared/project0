* Including at least one list, one table, and one image
* Use at least one stylesheet file for page styling
* Use at least 5 different CSS properties and at least 5 different types of
CSS selectors with #id and .class being used at least once
* Include at least one mobile-responsive @media query so that something about
the styling changes for smaller screens

also use at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap's
grid model
